Concept: Copper tier armor makes earlygame spelunking easier, iron tier helps with the toughest earlygame areas
Iron armor set effect: Increased defence and life regen when in the underworld, immunity to on fire! debuff
Lead armor set effect: Increased defence and life regen when in the jungle, immunity to poisoned debuff
Copper armor set effect: Increased movement speed and defence underwater
Tin armor set effect: Frog leg effect (jump heigh, fall speed, fall damage reduction) when underground
Note: I don't think anything in vanilla gives boosts when in a certain biome, so you'll have to see how Calamity does it.

Concept: Cobalt/Mithril/Adamantite armor sets are lame and weaker compared to Palladium/Orichalcum/Titanium. Give the sets passive accessory effects to allow for more accessory diversity.
Cobalt armor set bonus: Knockback immunity (cobalt shield effect), +1-2 life regen
Mithril armor set bonus: Stars fall on hit (star cloak effect), moderate defence boost for a short while after being hit
Adamantite armor set bonus: Increased invincibility time (cross necklace effect but even longer)
